One of the best things about sun dresses is their ability to keep you cool on hot summer days. The loose-fitting style allows air flow around your body, preventing overheating. Additionally, they often feature bright colors and bold patterns that reflect the sunny season.

Overall, owning at least one sun dress is a must-have in every woman's wardrobe during summertime. They're stylish yet practical enough to wear all day long while enjoying outdoor activities under the sun!
